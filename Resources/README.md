# Harmonic Tension Visualizer

*Currently in Development*

The goal of our project is to analyze a chord sequence, given by the user through an intuitive piano-roll interface, in order to determine the trend of the harmonic tension. Following different criteria, estabilished by us and based on music theory, we assign to each chord a certain level of tension, influenced by:
- the chord's composition, 
- well-known progression patterns,
- the harmonic context.

After these computations, the results of our analysis are graphically represented with dynamic visual effects while the chord progression is being played.

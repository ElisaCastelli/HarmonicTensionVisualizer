# Harmonic Tension Visualizer

The goal of our project is analyze a chords sequence, given by the user, in order to study the trend of the harmonic progression. Following criteria estabilished by us, we assign to each chord a certain level of tension based on both itsown composition and the chords progression in which it is.
After done these computations, the results of our analysis are graphically  represented in a dynamic way that changes behaviour while the chord progression is playing.
